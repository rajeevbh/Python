# Django
- If you are building a traditional web application with server-side rendering, forms, and built-in authentication, go with Django.
- If you need to create an API (especially for front-end frameworks or mobile apps), or you expect to expose your app’s data to external systems, go with Django REST Framework.
- Both can be used together, which allows you to mix server-rendered pages with API endpoints. The key is to assess your project’s needs and the architecture you’re aiming for.
